# Overview
## Description
SportsMeetup is a community app designed to bring together like-minded individuals who enjoy playing sports, participating in tournaments, and more. Users can create posts for sports pick-up games, indicating the location and time. 

Many sports enthusiasts often find themselves without a playing partner, particularly for team sports like volleyball. SportsMeetups provides an easy solution by connecting users within a specific range who are interested in playing the same sport and are open to playing with others found on the app.

The app's purpose is to simplify the process of finding individuals with similar sports interests to join in playing a game. All it takes is posting your activity, and you'll find a partner or even a whole group ready to join you in the game.

SportsMeetups functions as a mobile application where users can create an account. With this account, they can view posts about games in their area and either join existing games or create their own to invite others to join.
